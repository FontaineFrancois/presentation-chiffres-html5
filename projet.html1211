Gantz (Japanese: ガンツ Hepburn: Gantsu?) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hiroya Oku. </br>
Gantz tells the story of Kei Kurono and Masaru Kato, both whom died in a train accident and become part of a semi-posthumous </br>
"game" in which they and several other recently deceaed people are forced to hunt down and kill aliens armed with a handful of futuristic items, equipment, and weaponry. </br>
Both the manga and anime are noted for their heavy violence and sexual content. </br>
The Gantz anime adaptation, directed by Ichiro Itano and animated by Gonzo, contains 26 episodes divided into two seasons. </br>
A series of two live action movies based on the manga were produced and released in January–April 2011.[5] </br>

A pair of high school students, Kei Kurono and Masaru Kato, are hit by a subway train in an attempt to save </br>
the life of a drunk homeless man who had fallen onto the tracks. Following their deaths, Kurono and Kato find themselves </br>
transported to the interior of an unfurnished Tokyo apartment, where they meet Joichiro Nishi, a Gantz veteran, and other </br>
 clueless participants. The pair soon realizes that they are not allowed to leave the apartment. At one end of the room there </br>
 is a large black sphere known as "Gantz". </br>

After some time in the room, the Gantz sphere opens up, revealing a bald naked man with a breathing mask and wires attached to </br>
his head, and various weapons for them to use. These include the custom fitting black suits which give them super-human strength, </br>
speed, stamina and damage resistance, a controller which acts as a radar and stealth unit, X-gun, X-Shotgun, Y-Gun. Later on the </br>
series the Gantz sword, Gantz Bike are made available as well as much more powerful weapons are awarded in the 100 point menu.
